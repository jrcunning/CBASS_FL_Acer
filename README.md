### Census of heat tolerance among Florida's threatened staghorn corals identifies resilient individuals throughout nursery populations

by **Ross Cunning** and co-authors

In this manuscript, we describe the application of coral bleaching automated stress systems (CBASS) to measure the thermal tolerance of 228 colonies of *Acropora cervicornis* across six coral nurseries spanning Florida's coral reef. Quantitative metrics for each colony's thermal tolerance are derived using the Fv/Fm ED50, and variation in heat tolerance is analyzed with respect to genetic and environmental effects.
